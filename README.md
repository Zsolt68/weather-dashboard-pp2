## 🌐 Live Demo

Add your deployed link here once hosted on GitHub Pages:

## 🔧 How It Works

1. User enters a city name.  
2. JavaScript sends a request to the **OpenWeather Current Weather API**.  
3. If successful, the UI updates with:  
   - City name  
   - Temperature (°C)  
   - Weather description  
   - Humidity  
   - Wind speed  
   - Weather icon  
4. A second request retrieves the **5‑day forecast**, which is displayed as cards.  
5. Errors (e.g., invalid city) are handled gracefully.
