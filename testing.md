## Introduction

Here, I developed a testing plan to make sure that the weather-dashboard or website was functioning as intended. 

I ran my code through all validation and accessibility checkers noted below and have included screenshots of the results in this document. I also manually checked every feature of the site to ensure that it was working as intended and have included the results of this testing in this document.

## Automated Checks and Validation

This automated testing section contains all testing that has been run through a program to produce validation and performance insights.

### W3C Validator

[W3C](https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input) was used to validate the HTML and CSS for the site via direct text input. Result: Document checking completed. No errors or warnings to show.

### Jigsaw Validator
[Jigsaw](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator$link)  was used to validate the CSS for the site via direct text input. Result: Congratulations! No Error Found.

### Lighthouse

The Lighthouse tool within the Chrome Developer Tools has been used to test performance, best practices, accessibility, and SEO. Desktop and mobile tests have been run for each page.

| | Performance | Accessibility | Best Practice | SEO |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Desktop | 100 | 99 | 100 | 89 |
| Mobile | 100 | 99 | 100 | 89 |

### JSHint

[JSHint](https://jshint.com/) was used to test the JavaScript file in this project.

The JavaScript file tested with JSHint returned no errors.

### Testing User Goals

> * Search for a city and display the city's name and current temperature.

The weather dashboard is designed to be a simple way to search for a city name, then to display the city's temperature and 5-day weather forecast.

> * Be able to collect multiple/8 cities' searches and display them on the weather dashboard.
